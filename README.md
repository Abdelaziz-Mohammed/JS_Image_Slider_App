# JS_Image_Slider_App
HTML, CSS, and JS App at my learning journey.

# Image Slider App
A simple image slider built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to navigate through images using arrow buttons and bullet navigation.
The app also shows a message when users try to navigate beyond the available images.

## Notes
- This app is not fully responsive as I have focused on the logic behind it.
- So, it will not work well at screens less than 800px.

## Features
- Navigate through images using left and right arrow buttons.
- Bullet navigation to directly jump to any image.
- Visual feedback message when there are no more images to display.
- Smooth transition effects between images.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling the slider, buttons, and other elements.
- **JavaScript**: Adding dynamic functionality like navigation and transitions.
